											<h3>Learning New Skills </h3>
										</header>
										<p>I regularly find myself distracted or not being able to stay in one place for too long. Picking up new skills and activities is something that helps me because it occupies my mind. I found myself learning how to develop skills from sticker bombing my guitar correctly to making websites simply by using HTML and CSS. I actually learned to create and code websites for the purpose of showcasing my achievements and valuable traits for Caltech!</p>

											<h3>Drawing/Painting</h3>

										<p>In my bloodline from my Father's side, every man has and had the ability to draw really well naturally. My Father taught me how to develop my inherited skill in a way and become better at drawing with a reference and without one as well.</p>

											<h3>Guitar/Piano</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My Mother and Father both know how to play instruments, my mother plays the piano and my father the guitar. In Mexico, both of them tried to teach me how to play both insturments. I got really good at one point, nevertheless, when we moved to Los Angeles, the regular practices and lessons pretty much stopped. Nevertheless, for a while now I have been practicing my guitar and my keyboard, this has been helping me get my muscle memory back.</p>

											<h3>Training For Marathon/SRLA</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I never thought a year ago that I would be running regularly, let alone training for a marathon. When I got to my Senior year, I realized that throughout my whole time in High School, I never did any sports. Realizing this made me want to join one that I had interest in. Now, I train 3 times a week for around an hour a day and do a race every month, each time increasing by 3 miles. I have completed 2 half marathons so far, the next race will be 18 miles. The picture taken above is running my latest half marathon in front of Caltech!</p>

											<h3>Learning About Formula 1</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My interest in motorsport peaked when I joined the racing team in my High School. Ever since then, I began watching more and more Formula 1 races for various aspects like the mechanics of it, however, it has also helped me greatly in learning how the cars react under certain conditions and applying that to my team and my driving.</p>

											<h3>Learning About History (European)</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My interest for history is shared by my Mothers side of the family, with my Grandfather watching documentaries on World War I and II whenever he used to come to visit. Now, a couple years ago, my Mother discovered a Netflix Series called "The Crown" although we both know some parts of the series are exaggerated, we are still greatly interested in the history of the Royal Family of Britain. Furthermore, my own personal interest has expanded so much as to begin watching historic documentaries and movies like " Darkest Hour" and "Greatest Events of WWII In Colour".</p>

											<h3>Exploring California</h3>
										</header>
										<p>When not studying for tests, doing homework, or learning new skills to occupy my time, I also enjoy going outside and to new places where I haven't been before. I remember deciding to go online and search for historical towns in California (generally close to me) and discovering a town called Solvang. My parents and I decided to give it a shot and drive the hour and a half to the Danish town. It was an incredible experience and seeing how the community was so friendly and welcoming also added to the experience.</p>

											<h3>Go Karting</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Since I enjoy racing very much and love Formula 1, the closest I can get to experiencing that first hand right now is by going to my local Go Karting place. I usually go with my friends to just spend some time doing things we all love doing. I have actually won various races against my friends and other people too.</p>
